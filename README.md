# Identification-of-top-k-nodes-using-TOPSIS-method-and-community-detection-in-complex-Networks
This project can be divided into two parts, the first one is the detection of the top k-nodes in this case we use  the TOPSIS method implemented in topsis. Py file, after we start to compare the results with the centrality 
Measures using the SI model.
The second part is the community detection, we first tried to use the K-means to get clusters using different dynamic methods to  get the optimal number of clusters and the methods are tested on Zachary dataset 
To evaluate them, finally we use some of the known community detection algorithms like LOUVAIN and Greedy_modularity (implemeented in comm_detect.pynb)
